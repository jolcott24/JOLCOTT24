Welcome to my website. This website is designed to organize the results, methodologies, and data associated with my Summer 2020 Research Project. Mathematics Professor Jack O’Brien is my sponsor for this project. 

The State of Maine recently digitized a majority of the state’s election data through the Digital Maine State Archives. In this project, we use these records to perform statistical, historical, and governmental analyses of Maine’s political history. The ultimate goal of the project is to convert the digitized results into an accessible, open-source data resource of interest to the general public and academic researchers. We also aim to provide a tool to help users visualize these results in a simple but effective manner. This project marks an unparalleled attempt to quantitatively analyze a state’s political history over the course of centuries, and it will provide ample opportunity through the internet database to conduct further research.
